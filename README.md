# Dining Philosophers Problem

This is a basic implementation of the classic **Dining Philosophers Problem**, a synchronization problem often used in Operating Systems to demonstrate concepts like mutexes, semaphores, and thread coordination.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

The Dining Philosophers Problem illustrates the challenges of avoiding deadlock and ensuring resource sharing among multiple processes (philosophers) trying to access limited shared resources (forks/chopsticks).

## ðŸ‘¥ Group Members
